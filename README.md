# SQL-Stored-Procedures
This repository contains a sample of SQL I've written to accomplish common tasks.
In cases where it originates from outside projects, all structures and names have been altered.

The repo is helpful because sometimes even common tasks have somewhat verbose implementations in SQL,
and it's nice to have a prototype ready at hand.
